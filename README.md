When examining this trend by gender, we can see that men are far outpacing women and those of unknown gender in overall number of trips.  Those of unknown gender do not have a spike in shorter time rides that is seen in men and women, which may just be a function of the smaller sample size.  Most notably, one can see that the trend in shorter rides is 1)drven by men and 2) more prevalent among them.

Looking at trips by weekday per hour, hot spots in bike usage occur in morning (around 8am) and the evening hours (5-7pm).  This coupled with the previous findings indicates that perhaps the largest user segment of CitiBikes is commuters - specifically, males who live within a 5-10 minutes bike ride of their homes/subway stops.

## Summary

Citi bike services are largely utilized by males who have annual subscriptions.  Given the usage patterns by time of day, it's likely that these men are using Citi bike for communting - Assuming Des Moines, IA has a similar demographic they can tap into/market to, these services could enjoy similar success.  Consider advertising corporate specials to local businesses for subscription services.

In addtion to the charts presented, future analyses should consider age and location.  While several charts in the Module addressed these areas, they were not included in this submission for simpicity.  Given the analysis presented here and the potentiality for high commuter usage, these analyses could help direct marketing efforts and service areas.
